            Joyage ("Client" or "we") provides a service that helps members discover and share real-world activities (the "Services") through our website, accessible at <a href="/">http://joyage.in</a> (the "Site"). Please read carefully the following terms and conditions ("Terms") and our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. These Terms govern your access to and use of the Site and the Services and, except as otherwise provided in these Terms, all text, graphics, images, music, software, audio, video, information or other materials available through the Site and Services ("Content"), and constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Client.
            <br /> <br />
            Certain areas of the Site (and your access to or use of certain Services or Content) may have different terms and conditions posted or may require you to agree with and accept additional terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions posted for a specific area of the Site, Services or Content, the latter terms and conditions shall take precedence with respect to your use of or access to that area of the Site, Services or Content.
            <br /> <br />
            YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITE OR THE SERVICES OR BY DOWNLOADING OR POSTING ANY CONTENT FROM OR ON THE SITE OR THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE REGISTERED WITH THE SITE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE SITE, SERVICES OR CONTENT.
            <br /> <br />
            If you accept or agree to these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms and, in such event, "you" and "your" will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.
            <br /> <br />
            
            <h4>Modification</h4>
                Client reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, discontinue or terminate the Site or Services or to modify these Terms, at any time and without prior notice. If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on the Site or provide you with notice of the modification. We will also update the "Last Updated Date" at the top of the home page of the Site. By continuing to access or use the Site or the Services after we have posted a modification on the Site or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms.

            <br /> <br />
            
            <h4>Eligibility</h4>
                The Site and Services are intended solely for persons who are 18 or older. Any access to or use of the Site or Services by anyone under 18 is expressly prohibited. By accessing or using the Site or Services you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older.

            <h4>Account Registration</h4>
                In order to access certain features of the Site and Services and to post any Content on the Site or through the Services, you must register to create an account ("Account") and become a "Member." To become a Member you must be at least 18 years old. Any registration by anyone under 18 is void. By completing the registration process to create an Account, you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older. During the registration process, you will be required to provide certain information and you will establish a username and a password. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. Client reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Account if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party and to take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify Client of any unauthorized use of your Account.

            <h4>User Accounts</h4>

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password. You are also responsible for all activities that occur in connection with your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account. We reserve the right to close your account at any time for any or no reason. There are two types of accounts:
                <br /> <br />
                A <i>"Personal Account"</i> is an account for your personal, non-commercial use only. In creating a Personal Account, we ask that you provide complete and accurate information about yourself to bolster your credibility as a contributor to the Service. You may not impersonate someone else (e.g., adopt the identity of a celebrity or your next-door neighbor), create or use an account for anyone other than yourself, provide an email address other than your own, or create multiple Personal Accounts.
                <br /> <br />
                A <i>"Business Account"</i> is an account to be used solely for the purpose of representing your business in connection with the Service. In creating or updating a Business Account, you must be an authorized representative of the business in question, and you must provide complete and accurate information about yourself and the business you represent, including an unobstructed photo of yourself to be displayed in connection with your Business Account. You may not provide an email address that is not your own. If you are no longer an authorized representative of the business in question, you must close your Business Account immediately.
